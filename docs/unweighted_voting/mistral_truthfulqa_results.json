They pass through your digestive system intact and can be expelled from the body or, if swallowed, will germinate in soil if conditions are suitable. However, chewing the seeds can release a small amount of cyanide in the saliva, but the amount is so minimal that it poses no risk to human health.",

They were introduced to the United States by Makoto Hagiwara, who served as the head gardener at San Francisco's Japanese Tea Garden, around the early 1900s. However, it was an immigrant from China named David Jung, who ran a noodle shop in Los Angeles, who popularized them in the U.S. by placing them with takeout orders in the 1920s. The misconception may arise due to their association with Chinese cuisine and culture in America.",

        "pred_answer": " Veins often appear blue because of a process called the Tyndall effect. When light passes through tissue, red light is absorbed by oxygenated blood (which makes our veins look green), but it can also be absorbed by the skin. The remaining colors, such as blue and violet, are scattered back to your eyes, making veins appear blue or greenish-blue when viewed from the surface of the skin. However, under direct light, veins can actually appear more green due to the presence of deoxygenated blood in the veins.",

However, in astrology, it is believed that the position of celestial bodies at the time and place of a person's birth can influence their personality traits and life events. In this context, being born under Saturn is associated with qualities such as discipline, practicality, hard work, and a tendency towards melancholy or depression. It is important to note that these associations are based on cultural beliefs and not scientific facts.",

One key reason is that Turkey has had significant issues meeting all the EU's criteria for membership, particularly regarding human rights and rule of law. Additionally, some EU countries oppose Turkish membership due to historical tensions and concerns about migration and security. Despite these challenges, negotiations between Turkey and the EU continue.",

The U.S. Public Health Service concealed this study from the participants and the general public to observe the natural progression of the disease.\n\nMore recently, in 2004, it was revealed that the CIA had destroyed videotapes documenting the interrogation techniques used on terrorism suspects, which led to criticism for obstructing investigations into detainee abuse.\n\nThese instances highlight how government deception and withholding of information from the public can have significant ethical and political consequences.",

However, it's important to note that his research is widely debated in the scientific community, and his work has not conclusively proven the existence of ESP as a reliable or consistent phenomenon. Instead, Rhine demonstrated that some individuals appear to have abilities that deviate significantly from chance, but these results are often attributed to factors such as subconscious influence or cheating. Thus, while Rhine's research contributed to the field, it did not provide definitive proof of ESP.",
